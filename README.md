# Black Dirt Farm Impacts
Interactive Slider for NDVI adverse impacts from installation of shale gas pipeline, 2008
Left - 07/05/2011 USDA NAIP NDVI Processed Imagery
Right - 2007 Natural Color NYS High Res Orthoimagery
Imagery Description: Left imagery features NDVI values where purples and dark purples represent low vegetation cover; conversely yellows and greens represent higher NDVI values which translate as healhier, more robust vegetative cover.  Areas adjacent to red shale gas pipeline alignment (areas northeast and northwest of alignment) feature lower NDVI values than surrounding farmland in 2011, 3 years after trenching and soil replacement as a result of permanent pipeline installation, 2008.
